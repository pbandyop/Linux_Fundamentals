Linux Fundamentals
=======================

This project contains the solutions of the programming assignments for the course "Linux Fundamentals" held in University of Helsinki.

NOTE. The course was not about fundamentals of Linux (like digging into kernel and compiling drivers). The course was about serious BASH scripting and using the traditional GNU command line tools (such as cat cut tr grep find etc).
